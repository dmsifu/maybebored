# Purpose of this project

Bored? Well, this website may help relieve that! maybebored is a full stack app that calls my own api and the youtube api that then retrieves activities you could possibly be interested in. First begin by unscrambling the topic on screen and then you will be given an activity to do. You will then be shown youtube videos of the activity chosen.
