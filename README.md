# Purpose of this project

Bored? Well, this website may help relieve that! I created this site that calls the bored/youtube api and retrieves activities you could possibly be interested
in. First begin by unscrambling the topic on screen and then you will be given an activity to do. You will then be shown youtube videos of the activity
chosen.
